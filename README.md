# XBoard
XBoard is a web-based online collaborative “whiteboard” that empowers a group of users to share almost any kind of information under one “whiteboard”. It can be a block of text, a picture, a drawing, a website, or even a video… Every block is draggable and can be located anywhere on the board. XBoard can be used in many different working environments. For example, during the brainstorming phase, users can paste any related information onto the “whiteboard” and make connections among them.
